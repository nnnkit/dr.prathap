						<h5>what is</h5>
						<h1>Chiropractic ?</h1>
						<p>Chiropractic is a science, an art, and a philosophy that allows the body to function better by reducing interference on the nervous system. Using "Chiropractic Adjustments" (technique) to eliminate "Subluxations" (restricted vertebral segments) we are able to allow "Innate Intelligence" to help our bodies heal naturally.Innate Intelligence refers to the body's natural ability to heal itself. Our body is constantly replacing old, dead cells with new ones, without any extra help - it does this on its own! For example, when you cut yourself, blood comes out, then clots, then scabs over. You did not need to take medicine or get surgery to correct this! Chiropractic is a natural, conservative form of healthcare that neither introduces harmful chemicals to the body (medicines), nor does it open the body up to infections (surgeries). In fact, having a properly functioning nervous system improves your body's ability to fight illness. The brain sends signals to your body through the spinal cord. From the spinal cord, pairs of nerve roots exit to form major nerves, which go on to power all of the body's functions. Getting a Chiropractic Adjustment literally "turns the power on!"</p>

				<h6>Dr. Maanas S. (San Jose, USA)</h6>
				<p>"The first time I went to Dr. Prathap for a neck and back adjustment I thought the level of relief would be comparable to a massage, but in reality it was much more effective.  He was able to elicit responses and immediately modify his adjustment based on that.  Moreover, he explained everything he was doing very systematically and kept me at ease during the procedure.   Subsequent visits were excellent as well and he even gave me advice for some exercises to perform to reduce pain and improve mobility on an old knee injury that I mentioned was giving me trouble.  Dr. Prathap is an outstanding example of an expert in his field and I highly recommend his services."</p>

					<p>"Dr Prat is a talented chiropractor – the best I have ever seen. Because of Dr. Prat, I finally found relief from the chronic back and body pain I had lived with for 10 years. Dr. Prat’s unique integrative approach and in depth understanding of how the body works made it possible for him to: identify the root causes of my pain; help me understand the steps that could be taken to fix my problems; and make me feel better than I have ever before. Dr. Prat is friendly, caring, knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with. 
					Dr Prat’s holistic understanding of how connected the different systems of the body are, allowed him to fix my back, neck and hip pain but also to help improve my overall health. By fixing my body structurally, I saw improvement in my digestion, and my menstrual cycle became regular for the first time in 8 months. I am so very grateful to be living pain free and in better health. Dr. Prat did more than just treat me. He enthusiastically worked WITH me to help me achieve optimal health. He gave me easy to follow exercises that could be done at home to compliment his treatments. His positive outlook and passion for his work made it easy for me to finally commit to helping myself. Dr. Prat inspired me to take better care of my health and to love my body. Thank you, Dr. Prat, for helping me discover what it feels like to live pain free." </p>
